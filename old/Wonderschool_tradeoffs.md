Trade-Off Decisions:

1. Caching with a Dedicated Caching Service:
Pros: Using a dedicated caching service (e.g., Redis, Memcached) allows for more fine-grained control over caching, including expiration times, eviction policies, and distribution across multiple instances.
Cons: Adds complexity to infrastructure and adds additional costs for maintaining and scaling the caching service.
2. AWS Lambda's:
Pros: A serverless architecture (e.g., AWS Lambda, Azure Functions) can automatically scale based on demand, reducing infrastructure management overhead.
Cons: Cold start times for serverless functions can introduce latency. The serverless model may not be suitable for long-running tasks or require special considerations for stateful operations.


CACHING:

To achieve caching and storage of data at various stages (raw data, mapped data, calculated data, and recommendation output), you can use a combination of in-memory caching and a persistent storage solution like DynamoDB.

I've added separate caches for raw data, mapped data, calculated data, and recommendation data.
Each cache is checked before fetching or calculating the data to see if it has already been processed.
Data is still stored in DynamoDB, as in the previous version, but now you can customize the storage logic based on the specific data you want to persist.


Security: Ensure that sensitive credentials, such as API keys and access tokens, are stored securely. Avoid hardcoding them in the source code, and consider using environment variables or a secure configuration management solution.

Rate Limiting: Consider implementing pagination for API responses that may return a large amount of data. Also, be aware of any rate limits imposed by third-party APIs and design your application to handle them gracefully.


DATA-MAPPING:

The choice of where to perform data mapping (in a Python script, AWS Lambda, or Apache Airflow) involves trade-offs that depend on various factors such as performance, scalability, ease of maintenance, and the specific requirements of your application. Here are some considerations for each option:

Data Mapping in a Python Script:
Advantages:

Flexibility: You have full control over the mapping logic and can use Python's rich ecosystem of libraries to perform complex transformations.
Ease of Debugging: Debugging and testing Python scripts can be straightforward, and you can easily log and inspect intermediate results.
Disadvantages:

Maintenance: If mapping logic needs frequent updates or changes, managing and deploying a Python script can become challenging.
Scalability: Depending on the complexity of the mapping, running it as a script may become a bottleneck, especially as data volumes increase.
Data Mapping in AWS Lambda:
Advantages:

Serverless Architecture: Lambda provides a serverless environment, meaning you don't need to manage infrastructure, and it automatically scales based on demand.
Integration with AWS Services: Lambda can easily integrate with other AWS services, making it seamless to connect to data sources, process data, and store results.
Disadvantages:

Cold Starts: Lambdas may experience cold starts, resulting in a delay for the first execution after a period of inactivity.
Execution Time Limits: Lambda has a maximum execution time limit (15 minutes as of my knowledge cutoff in January 2022), which may be a constraint for long-running mapping tasks.

Consider Python for Complex Logic: If your data mappings involve complex transformations or logic, a Python script may provide the flexibility needed.

Explore AWS Lambda for Scalability: If you need scalability and want a serverless architecture, AWS Lambda could be a good fit, especially if you are already utilizing AWS services.

API DESIGN DECISIONS:
3rd-Party Raw-Data API GET Endpoint:(Separate vs inside /transformed-data GET call):
Separate allows for more flexibility and control over the data flow. If someone pulls data from QuickBooks but stops the program before the transformation, you would still have the raw data available for future processing or analysis.

This separation allows you to have more control over the data flow and ensures that raw data is available even if someone stops the program before the transformation step. Clients can fetch raw data and, at a later time, trigger the transformation process when they're ready.

3rd-Party Transformed-Data API GET Endpoint:(Separate vs inside /calculate GET call):
Combining the /transformed-data and /calculate endpoints can make sense in certain scenarios, especially if the transformed data retrieved from airflow is directly used in the calculations.

The /calculate endpoint is designed to perform calculations based on the data received in the request body. This allows flexibility in case the data used for calculations is not directly tied to the transformed data obtained from airflow.

Keep the two endpoints separate to ensure the transformed data is fetched before calculations are performed.

Cons:
Reduced Latency: By directly using the transformed data in the /calculate endpoint, you may reduce the overall latency by eliminating an additional request to fetch transformed data.
