Trade-Off Decisions:

SNS/SQS for Notifications vs. Lambdas:
1. Decoupling: SNS & SQS allows you to decouple from the sender/producer (Lambda).
2. Scalability: SNS and SQS are more design to handle high throughput and can distribute load efficiently and be managed.
3. You can fan out with scaling if many messages need to be sent out.

API-Gateway + Lambdas vs. Server-based approach (EC2):
1. Costs less (billed by compute time)
2. Automatic scaling (scales in response to traffic/incoming requests)
3. No server management
4. Event-driven architecture and builds serverless workflows
5. Reduced development time

Cacheing:
Pro's: reliability
Con's: real-time data, readily available, cost of cache management / complex invalidations, latency issues

For scaling:
Auto-scaling, pay-per-use, event-drive architecture, loose coupling between components, easy to modify/replace, global distribution

For deploying:
No infrastructure management, contiuous deployment, automated through CI/CD pipeline, each Lambda can be deployed independently, managed services through AWS, automated rollback


Open vs. Closed API:
Closed: Control over data fed into recommendation engine, simplified user experience, security
Open: More growth/usage
Concerns: Security concerns (API key), rate limiting, heavy documentation, monitoring/analytics. Would need to modify APIs to handle large bulk sets of data and introduce pagination.




1. Caching with a Dedicated Caching Service:
Pros: Using a dedicated caching service (e.g., Redis, Memcached) allows for more fine-grained control over caching, including expiration times, eviction policies, and distribution across multiple instances.
Cons: Adds complexity to infrastructure and adds additional costs for maintaining and scaling the caching service.
2. AWS Lambda's:
Pros: A serverless architecture (e.g., AWS Lambda, Azure Functions) can automatically scale based on demand, reducing infrastructure management overhead.
Cons: Cold start times for serverless functions can introduce latency. The serverless model may not be suitable for long-running tasks or require special considerations for stateful operations.


CACHING:

To achieve caching and storage of data at various stages (raw data, mapped data, calculated data, and recommendation output), you can use a combination of in-memory caching and a persistent storage solution like DynamoDB.

I've added separate caches for raw data, mapped data, calculated data, and recommendation data.
Each cache is checked before fetching or calculating the data to see if it has already been processed.
Data is still stored in DynamoDB, as in the previous version, but now you can customize the storage logic based on the specific data you want to persist.


Security: Ensure that sensitive credentials, such as API keys and access tokens, are stored securely. Avoid hardcoding them in the source code, and consider using environment variables or a secure configuration management solution.

Rate Limiting: Consider implementing pagination for API responses that may return a large amount of data. Also, be aware of any rate limits imposed by third-party APIs and design your application to handle them gracefully.
